## Introduction
This is a mandatory group project  of the courses “FS19-6,781,1.00 Skills: Programming: Introduction Level“ and “Advanced” supervised by Dr. Mario Silic in the spring semester, 2019, at the University of St. Gallen. The project was done in a group of five people: Maï Billharz, Lea Buffenoir, Julia Hartweg, Muriel Strasser and Yi Zheng. 
The goal is to analyze the factors impacting students performance in exams using a simple and then multiple regression analysis. We also developed a prediction tool. 

## Repository

There are five files distributed within this repository. "README.md" is used for a project description as well as insutrctions. "Regression Analysis - Group Project Python.ipynb" and "Regression Analysis - Group Project Python.py" contain code.

The file "StudentsPerformance.csv" is a dataset downloaded from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams), which this project is based on.

The file "Prediction Tool Output - Screenshots.docx" shows the output of the prediction tool, which pop ups in a new window. It predicts the math score using user input.

## Installations 
To do our analysis we use these programs: 
* Python 3.7.3
* Anaconda 3
* Jupiter

To run our code you will need these packages and datasets: 
* Packages: numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, pylab, sklearn, statsmodels.api, tkinter 
* Dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams) 

## Set Up 
To run the code you have to save the kaggle dataset as CSV on your computer.
